### More Information

If you've made it this far, you have decided you want to know a little bit more
about me.  Well, here goes.

Software...  I love building software.  But not just any software.  I love building
software that I'm proud of; that people will use.  I love building software that uses
interesting technology stacks; from ASP.NET Core and C# to kernel modules in C.  I
love building software that helps the world.  I love building software that solves a
fun problem.  I love building software for mobile, web, backend systems, and even the
small control board operating the isolated contact switch for my fireplace.  Software
development is not a job for me, it is my passion.

My employer phrases it best: "We build awesome software". [InfernoRed](http://infernored.com)
is an incredible place to work.  I've been there since April of 2014 and I hope that
I'm still there when I decide to retire.  I've never been part of a better team.
